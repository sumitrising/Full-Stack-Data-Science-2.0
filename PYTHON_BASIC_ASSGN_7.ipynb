    "# 1.What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?\n",
    "# Ans:- re.compile() is used for generating Regex objects. \n",
    "# 2.Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "# Ans:-  Raw string is used when a string needs to contain a backslash(\\).\n",
    "# 3. What is the return value of the search() method?\n",
    "# Ans:- search() method returns matched objects in the string.\n",
    "# 4. From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?\n",
    "# Ans:-group() method returns matched string from a group of string.\n",
    "# 5. In the regex which created from the r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)', what does group zero cover? Group 2? Group 1?\n",
    "# Ans:- In the Regex r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)' the zero group covers the entire pattern match whereas the first group cover (\\d\\d\\d) and the second group cover (\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d).\n",
    "# 6. In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?\n",
    "# Ans:- The \\. \\( and \\) escape characters in the raw string passed to re.compile() will match actual parenthesis characters.\n",
    "# 7. The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of the two options?\n",
    "# Ans:- If the regex pattern has no groups, a list of strings matched is returned. if the regex pattern has groups, a list of tuple of strings is returned.\n",
    "# 8. In standard expressions, what does the | character mean?\n",
    "# Ans:- In standard expressions , the | character means  Or.\n",
    "# 9. In regular expressions, what does ? the character stand for?\n",
    "# Ans:- In regular Expressions, ? characters represents zero or one match of the preceding group.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10.In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters?\n",
    "# Ans:- The + matches one or more, the * matches zero or more of the preceding group.\n",
    "# 11. What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression?\n",
    "# Ans:- {4} means that its preceding group should repeat 4 times. whereas {4,5} means that its preceding group should repeat minimum 4 times and maximum 5 times.\n",
    "# 12. What do you mean by the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "# Ans:- \\d, \\w and \\s are special sequences in regular expressions in python:\n",
    "# \\d – Matches digit character equivalent to [0-9]\n",
    "# \\w – Matches a word character equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9]\n",
    "# \\s – Matches whitespace character (space, tab, newline, etc.)\n",
    "# 13. What do means by \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "# Ans:- \\D, \\W and \\S are special sequences in regular expressions in python:\n",
    "# \\D – Matches any non-digit character, this is equivalent to the set class [^0-9]\n",
    "# \\W – Matches any non-alphanumeric character equivalent to [^a-zA-Z0-9]\n",
    "# \\S – Matches any non-whitespace character\n",
    "# 14. What is the difference between .*? and .*?\n",
    "# Ans:- .* is a Greedy mode, which returns the longest string that meets the condition. Whereas .*? is a non greedy mode which returns the shortest string that meets the condition.\n",
    "# 15. What is the syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class?\n",
    "# Ans:- The Syntax for matching both numbers and lower case letters  is Either [a-z0-9] or [0-9a-z].\n",
    "\n",
    "# 16. What is the procedure for making a normal expression in regax case insensitive?\n",
    "# Ans:- re.IGNORECASE as a flag to make a normal expression case insensitive\n",
    "# 17. What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as 2nd argument in re.compile()?\n",
    "# Ans:- The .character normally matches any character except the newline character. If re.DOTALL is passed as the second argument to re.compile(), then the dot will also match newline characters.\n",
    "# 18. If numReg = re.compile(r'\\d+'), what will numRegex.sub('X', '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hen') return?\n",
    "# Ans:- The output of  the string 'X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hens'.\n",
    "# 19. What does passing re.VERBOSE as the 2nd argument to re.compile() allow to do?\n",
    "# Ans:- re.VERBOSE will allow to add whitespace and comments to string passed to re.compile()\n"
